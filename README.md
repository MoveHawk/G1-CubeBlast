Color Cubes Smash is a Hyper-casual Unity game inspired by timeless classics like Fruit Ninja and Smash Hit. <br>
<br>
This project explores precision-based tap gameplay where players must smash the correct colored cubes as they are tossed into play. It combines the fast-paced engagement of Fruit Ninja with the clean, atmospheric style of Smash Hit. <br>
<br>
Key areas I focused on during development: <br>
ðŸŽ® Gameplay systems â€“ randomization, fairness mechanics, and difficulty balancing. <br>
ðŸ–¥ UI/UX design â€“ Scalable Cross Platform UI (Android/PC), smooth transitions, polished visual presentation & Graphic design. <br>
ðŸ“± Platform optimization â€“ consistent performance across PC & Android, with an optimized build size for mobile deployment. (32 MBs) <br>
<br>
