Introducing my latest project: Color Cubes Smash!
Hyper-casual Unity game inspired by timeless classics like Fruit Ninja and Smash Hit.

This project explores precision-based tap gameplay where players must smash the correct colored cubes as they are tossed into play. It combines the fast-paced engagement of Fruit Ninja with the clean, atmospheric style of Smash Hit. 

Key areas I focused on during development: 
ðŸŽ® Gameplay systems â€“ randomization, fairness mechanics, and difficulty balancing. 
ðŸ–¥ UI/UX design â€“ Scalable Cross Platform UI (Android/PC), smooth transitions, polished visual presentation & Graphic design.
ðŸ“± Platform optimization â€“ consistent performance across PC & Android, with an optimized build size for mobile deployment. (32 MBs)

ðŸŽµ A special thanks to Zen_Man for providing an amazing music track that elevates the atmosphere of the game! His contribution really brought the experience to life.
